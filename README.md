# NanoCore Network Inspector

_I Can't seem to get enough of this application_

Had this still lying around in my projects folder the past couple months so I decided to put it up on GitHub.

This application (attempts to) detect and display NanoCore traffic that is flowing through the device, which can be used to determine if and what an attacker is doing on someones machine using NanoCore.
